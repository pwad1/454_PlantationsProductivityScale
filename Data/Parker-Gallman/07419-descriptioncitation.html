		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This study presents 1860 data on population and farm
production in 5,228 farms located in 405 major cotton-producing
counties in the South. The data was compiled from the agriculture,
slave, and population schedules of the 1860 United States manuscript
Census. For each farm, variables describing farm land, machinery,
crops, and livestock are included, as well as production figures for
specific crops and types of livestock on the farm. The population
variables tabulate the free and slave residents of each farm by sex,
race, and age in five- or ten-year categories.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Scope of Project:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Time Period(s):</strong> 1860</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> ICPSR added Variable 236, representing an
identification number given to each farm, to the original data.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> A total of 405 counties produced over 1,000 bales of
 cotton in 1860. A random bloc of five farms was selected from every
 280 farms located in the target counties (i.e., a five-farm bloc from
 every 14th page of the manuscript Census). The resulting sample
 thus comprised 1.67 percent of all farms in the major cotton-growing
counties of the 11 states forming the Confederacy.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> All farms located in Southern counties that produced over
1,000 bales of cotton in 1860.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Source:</strong> Schedules 1 (free population), 2 (slave population),
and 4 (agricultural production) of the 1860 manuscript U.S. Census</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> census/enumeration data</span></p>

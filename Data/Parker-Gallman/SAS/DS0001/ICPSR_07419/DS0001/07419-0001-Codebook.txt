           Information on farm production and population residing on farms in the    
     Southern United States in 1860 is included in this dataset. The data were       
     originally collected by William N. Parker, Yale University, and Robert E.       
     Gallman, University of North Carolina, with the financial assistance of a grant 
     from the National Science Foundation. ICPSR received the data from Stanley      
     Engerman at the University of Rochester.                                        
                                                                                     
           The dataset contains variables recorded for 5,228 farms located in        
     the major cotton-producing counties of the South. The farms appearing in        
     the file were selected from the 1860 manuscript U.S. Census schedules by a      
     sample of all farms in 405 Southern counties which each produced over 1,000     
     bales of cotton in 1860. The sampling method employed chose a random bloc       
     of five farms from every 280 farms in the selected counties (i.e., a five-      
     farm bloc from very fourteenth page of the manuscript census); this resulted    
     in a 1.67 percent sample of all farms in the major cotton-growing counties      
     of the eleven states of the Confederacy. The sampling procedure is further      
     described in James D. Foust, "The Yeoman Farmer and Westward Expansion of       
     U.S. Cotton Production" (see below). [In the original sample, data for 5,229    
     farms were collected. The data record for one farm, however, could not be       
     read upon initial transmission of the data to the University of Rochester.      
     The file received by ICPSR therefore contains information for only 5,228 farms.]
                                                                                     
          In compiling the data collection, the principal investigators collated     
     information on each farm selected in the sample from three schedules of the     
     1860 census: data on the free population residing on each farm from Schedule    
     No. 1; slave population data from Schedule No. 2; and agricultural production   
     data from Schedule No. 4. Variables recording information from these three      
     sources appear in standard locations for each farm in the present dataset. The  
     following pages describe the variables contained in the dataset.                
                                                                                     
          The dataset contains 236 variables for each of the 5,228 farms drawn by    
     the sample. The first three variables identify and describe the county in which 
     each farm is located. Variable 4 cites the page and line in the manuscript      
     agricultural Schedule (No. 4) from which a portion of the data for each farm    
     was collected. Forty-eight variables recording assets, land, inventories, and   
     commodity production on each farm are presented next, followed by a "check      
     total" (variable 54) which is the numeric sum of the previous 53 variables. The 
     remaining 182 variables record the population residing on the farm, and are     
     presented for detailed categories of age, race, sex and "status" (free or       
     slave). Variable 235, total population residing on the farm, represents the sum 
     of the prior population categories. Variable 236 is a sequential number given   
     to each farm for identification purposes.

           In addition to the preparation of this documentation for the data file,   
     ICPSR performed computer-assisted editing of the entire data file. This         
     operation checked the data variables for invalid (i.e. alpha-numeric)           
     characters, converted leading blanks in the data fields to leading zeros, and   
     performed the contingency check indicated by the nature of variables 54 and 235 
     (see the descriptions for those variables below). No invalid characters or      
     anomalous conditions were discovered by these procedures and, except for the    
     "padding" of leading zeros in the data fields, the file is in essentially the   
     same format as received by ICPSR from the University of Rochester. The only     
     addition to this original data file is variable 236, a identification number    
     given to each farm.
